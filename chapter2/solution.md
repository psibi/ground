# Know the Concepts

* Fetch-Execute style: CPU reads in instructions from memory one at a
  time and executes them.

* Special, high speed memory location on processors is called
  register. Theoretically it should be possible to do the computation
  without registers, but it would be highly inefficient.

* Represent it in two bytes. (1 byte = 8 bits, so 2^8 = 256)

* Four bytes.

* Computer doesn't know. It depends on the instructions passed to the
  processor. Based on the instructions, it will interpret the memory
  accordingly.

* [Data Accessing methods](https://github.com/psibi/ground/blob/master/chapter2/Notes.md#data-accessing-methods)

* Instruction pointer: points to a memory word which is loaded as an
  instruction.

# Use the Concepts

* Lay it out like the second method used in Page 14.

* Indexed addressing mode

* 3142

* 6532

* 123472

* 9123498

# Going Further

* Theoretically, one seems sufficient.

* Convenience, efficiency.
