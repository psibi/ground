# All About Functions

## How Functions work

A function is comprised of

* function name
* function parameters
* local variables
* static variables: are data storage that a function uses while
  processing that is not thrown away afterwards, but is reused for
  every time the function's code is activate.
* global variables
* return address: is a parameter which tells the function where to
  resume executing after the function is completed.
* return value

* The way the variables are stored and the parameters and return
values are transferred by the computer varies from language to
language. This variance is known as language's calling convention
because it describes how functions expect to get and receive data whey
they are called.

* Assembly language can use any calling convention it wants
  to. However, if you want to interoperate with functions written in
  other languages, you have to obey their calling conventions.

* Note that the book uses the `C` programming language calling
  convention as that's the most widely used.
