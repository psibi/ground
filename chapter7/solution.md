## Know the Concepts

* Programmers are bad esitmators of time. They don't include meeting,
  iteration based on feedback etc when scheduling.
* External activity
* [Corner case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case). Example: 1/0, 0/0
* To find out bugs.
* Stubs are dummy implementation. Drivers are the developed functions
  whose sole purpose is to call functions for testing. They simply
  load your function, supply it with data and check the results.
* Recovery points are basic units for error recovery. One of the
  simples recovery point is having a simple error-reporting function
  that you can call with an error code and a message. The funcion
  would print them and simply exit the program.
* As many different error scenarios your program has.

## Use the concepts

Doing only the third program as it's more challenging.
